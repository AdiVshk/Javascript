// In-built functions
// Javascript has many different in-built functions which can do different things  for you
// You can create your own  functions but later in the course

// console.log()
// What is console.log()

// this function takes some data as input and then displays them in the output

// this function can take multiple arguments all together

console.log(10); // 10
console.log('Hello World'); // "Hello World"

let age = 13;
console.log(age);

// its only task is to display on the screen

// you can pass multiple values

// if we have two different console.log then both of them displays / prints output in two  different line

// we can also pass multiple values together to console.log() and all of them will be on the same line

console.log(10, 'starting', 343, true);

// you can pass comma seperated values that will give output in the same line
